When Philip awoke it was already dark. He planned to make a beeline straight to the red flower district for some fun.

After a couple hours of searching Philip had finally arrived. He was greeted by several strange females asking to show him a good time and a few shady men offering to show him to the forbidden nectar for a small fee. Philip had always heard about the illicit nectar, but had never seriously considered trying it. Now he had no reason not to. He figured that would be the perfect way to start the night. He tossed a few dollars to one of the shady gents and followed him for a couple meters.

Finally, the guy pulled a branch aside and unveiled a red flower that glistened in the moonlight.

“Be careful now, kid, too much can kill you,” the sketchy guy muttered.

Philip gingerly sipped the nectar and felt a wave of pleasure propagate through his entire body. It was unlike anything he had ever felt. He felt so alive. He took another sip that compounded the ecstasy. Now he wanted to get to know the ladies.

And that’s how it went the entire night. Philip would spend long intervals cavorting with the strange women of the red flower district, and then head back to the forbidden nectar when he needed to refuel. By morning Philip’s heart had given out and he laid dead next to the red flower, robbed of all his personal belongings.

That night Philip had truly lived for the first time, even though it killed him.
