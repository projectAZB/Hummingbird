One day Philip was humming along, and overheard a couple of humans chatting. They must have noticed him.

“Look how beautiful that hummingbird is,” the one girl said.

“Yeah it’s pretty great. They’re fascinating creatures. You know their hearts beat over one-thousand times per minute? That’s how they can move their wings so fast,” the other marveled.

Philip couldn’t believe his ears. One-thousand times in a minute has to be impossible. He honed in on his heartbeat and was astounded by how fast it was going. This can’t be safe, he insisted to himself. He fluttered off to go confront his brood about the discovery.
