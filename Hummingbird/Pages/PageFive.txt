It was a sweltering day so Philip was on the hunt for a bird bath. He could only ever go on days his father allowed before. No more. Philip was a free bird.

After a bit of searching, he spotted one with a couple of birds already in it. As he got closer he realized it was two females. Perfect, Philip thought to himself.

“Hello, Ladies,” Philip said from an awkward distance.

“Hi,” the one said uncomfortably.

He flew into the pool and made a considerable splash.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it? What charm are you gals from?” Philip said, a little too eagerly.

The other one mumbled what sounded like a goodbye and then they both flew off.

Look on the bright side, now I have it all to myself, Philip thought to himself. He sat there ruminating for a while and then decided to go take a long afternoon nap. He found a suitable branch and hung. He thought how he would finally be able to take part of the seething nightlife he only heard bird whispers about before. They called it the “red flower district.”
