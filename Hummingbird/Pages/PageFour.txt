As his kin were unhinging themselves from the branch at the break of dawn, Philip hovered over to them to break his news.

“Guys, did you know that we will stop existing someday?”

“What are you talking about Philip,” his brother Martin said with a sigh.

“The world stops for us one day, Martin,” Philip snidely retorted.

Philip’s father turned, preparing himself to finally chirp in.

“Philip, I am about tired of your nonsense. In order for a charm to survive, we must all pull our own weight, which isn’t too much to ask. But, you are constantly lost in your own foolish musings, and bringing us down. This is your warning.”

“No need, you won’t have to worry about me bringing you down any more. I’m going to enjoy my short existence and experience all there is in this world instead of slaving away for you and limiting my life by all your arbitrary rules,” Philip asserted, turning slowly away from the group.

“Philip please don’t go,” his mother said mawkishly as his father held her back.

But Philip was already gone. He had cast off the chains of the charm.
